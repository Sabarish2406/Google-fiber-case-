Created a summary document that describes the Google Fiber customer service teamâ€™s business needs, project goals, dashboard functionality, and BI methods. The projecct tracks the number of calls made to google fiber's customer service team helping understand how effectively the team helps its customers answer their questions and concerns in their first call. The dashboard explains how many calls and repeat calls are received and those customers who's queires are attended to on their fist call
